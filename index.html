  <p>Many different authors contributed to the <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/성경" target="_blank" title="성경에 대해서">Bible</a>. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents.<br>The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about the contents of the canon, primarily the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect.</p>
